I extracted 2019-based data from a huge set covering traffic accidents in the contiguous 48 US states from 2016 to 2019.
The dataset can be found here: https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents.
I used cumulative logit regression with proportional odds approach to analyze the data and build the prediction model as my response variable (Severity) 
has 4 categorical levels.
